\begin{abstract}
To determine an absolute position and orientation of a robot is not a simple task. Every sensor is subject to noise and errors of some sort, even systems such as the Global Navigation System used in many systems today is subject to large amount of noise and error, making their direct usage less useful. To overcome this, this report demonstrates a method which combines an instantaneous, fast updating, inertia and wheel encoder based estimate, with a slower, delayed beacon based reference position. These estimates are fused using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which is modified to account for the delayed, multirate, multisensor system that is used by incorporating Alexander's Method. The results showed that while the modified EKF worked quite well in and of itself, despite a relatively low update rate, systemic errors introduced in the absolute position reference caused a fair amount of error while traveling at higher velocities.
