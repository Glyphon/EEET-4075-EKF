  abstract = "In this paper the data fusion problem for asynchronous, multirate, multisensor linear systems is studied. The linear system is observed by multiple sensor systems, each having a different sampling rate. Under the assumption that the state space model is known at the scale of the highest time resolution sensor system, and that there is a known mathematical relationship between the sampling rates, a comprehensive state space model that includes all sensor systems is presented. The state vector is estimated with a neural network that fuses the outputs of multiple Kalman filters, one filter for each sensor system. The state estimate is shown to perform better than other data fusion approaches due to the new neural network based sensor fusion approach."

abstract="Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is one active research area in robotics. SLAM using only landmarks is an efficient method without relying on dead reckoning (DR) or inertial navigation system (INS), hence informations such as position provided by inertial devices will simply abandoned. To optimize the use of available information, one novel approach of SLAM for indoor positioning with only RPLidar, a low cost laser lidar, is proposed in this paper. First, one improved structure of SLAM using landmarks with particle matching algorithm is introduced. Second, a novel landmark selection method is presented, which takes the quality of observation into consideration too besides the angles between the landmarks. Third, the number of the landmarks needed in the triangulation approach in localization is decreased by utilizing the range information provided by the RPLidar. Experimental results show that the new approach for SLAM with only RPLidar works well, which demonstrates that the low cost low precision laser lidar can also play significant role in robotics with the aid of particle matching and landmark selection algorithms.",

The number and variety of sensors make it desirable to distribute the computational burden of sensing and estimation among multiple processors. Classic Kalman filters do not lend themselves to distributed implementations or delayed measurement data. The alternative Kalman filter designs presented in this paper are adapted for delays in sensor data generation and for distribution of computation for sensing and estimation over a set of networked processors.},
