\cite{multi} has infor on multirate, multisensor data fusion. Extracted info includes being able to cascade EKFs into each other indefinitely to allow for many sensors and rates to be included. \cite{indoor} is more for lidar and imu based navigation, used for comparison more than anything. \cite{delayed} specifies different ways to fuse delayed measurements together. \cite{alex} explains the specific method in detail from its creator. \cite{beacon} has information regarding beacon based navigation and triangulation.\par

Several different ways to combine the estimations of different sensors, difficulties with multi-rate systems. Variants or modifications on EKF and UKF, compare and contrast, computational cost, relative accuracy, limitations. maybe compare to particle filters as well? Need for an initial estimate of position and heading. Beacon based navigation.\par
	Using Alexander's Method for fusion of absolute and dead reckoning system due to update rate of LiDaR being much slower than that of odometry and IMU.
