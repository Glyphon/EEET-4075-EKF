\PARstart{T}{he} ability to determine a robot's position and orientation is an important requirement for a lot of mobile robotic systems. Without it, their capabilities are quite limited. To measure these directly however, slow, and often delayed measurements need to be taken, assuming they can be taken at all. Another method is to use faster, instantaneous dead reckoning techniques to estimate the position and orientation. Except all dead reckoning techniques inherently have accumulation error so the problem presents itself, How does one use the two together to get the best of both worlds?\par
This report uses a combination of methods described in the literature review below to achieve the following, to estimate an absolute pose using a beacon based navigation system, to estimate the relative pose using both an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel encoders, and to fuse these measurements in a way that offers the best compromise between accuracy, and efficiency using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or some derivative of.
